The Doll, everyone's (at least second) favorite feminine character in Bloodborne. The caretaker of the hunter's dream and the guide to transcendence, ever looking out for the player. How can she possibly embody the source of all the nightmares and be accused for overpowering The Great Ones in causing agony to the protagonist, but in some interpretations — she just could. If you think about it, she continuously sends you onto quests for worth, in a world that has none.
