So… what brought you here?

Okay, I’m *still* working on this page.  
I appreciate that you’re interested in getting to know more about me, but honestly, I can’t think of anything to share off the top of my head right now.

If you’re disappointed, here’s a list of books that might be more worthy of your time:

- *Meditations*  
- *The Myth of Sisyphus*  
- *The Third Chimpanzee*  
- *The Village Teacher*  


<!-- Okay I need to test of this comments works, okay it does, you don't see it -->


> Take a page out of my suggestions if you want, or read whatever that brings you joy.
